             *
             * Interrupting an application's (/library's) internal thread that has a certain purpose, state and
             * dependency to other parts of the application state by a generic technical is pretty much the same
             * dangerous nonsense as Thread#stop:
             * A thread embedded in a complex context and state can't be stopped or interrupted "just like that".
             * What should a crucial thread do on such a request? Say a thread that updates a database's lock file
             * to indicate it is actively used. Should it just terminate and stop updating the lock file that secures
             * the database despite the other threads still accessing the database? Surely not.
             * Or should it prematurely write the update, because "some doesn't want to wait any longer"? Nonsense.
             * No external interference bypassing the specific logic and ignoring the state and complexity of the
             * application makes sense. It is pure and utter nonsense to interrupt such a thread in such a generic
             * and ignorant way.
             *
             * Whoever (in terms of program logic, of course) wants a certain thread to stop must use the proper
             * methods to do so, that properly control the application state, etc.
             * If there are none provided, then the thread is not supposed to be stoppable or interrupt-able.
             * It's that simple.
             *
             * If a managing layer (like the OS) wants to shut down the application, it has to use its proper
             * interfacing means for that, but never pick out single threads and stop or interrupt them one by one.
             * Generic interruption CAN be useful IF the logic explicitly supports it.
             * Otherwise, this is just another JDK naivety that does more harm than good.
             * Thread#stop has been deprecated and so should generic interruption be.
